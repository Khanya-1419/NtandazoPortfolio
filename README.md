This is my personal portfolio website built using ASP.NET Core MVC. It represents my background, skills, and experience in a clean and professional way. I studied ICT in Business Analysis at the Durban University of Technology, where I focused on Business Information Systems and Application Development. I have practical experience working with C#, SQL, and various business analysis tools, as well as real-world IT exposure through my internship at a municipality in the West Rand. The site includes an overview of who I am, along with my contact details and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. The design is clean, responsive, and built to grow as I continue learning and improving my skills. This project reflects both my passion for technology and my commitment to continuous growth in the software development field.
